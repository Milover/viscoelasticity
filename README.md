## General

This is a somewhat modified port of the `viscoelasticFluidFoam` solver for
OpenFOAM v2016.

Only a steady state version of the solver is available currently, along with
some rheological models (Newtonian, Carreau-Yasuda, PTT). The solver assumes
a laminar, isothermal flow of an incompressible fluid.

More stuff to be added at a later point.


## TODO

- [ ] add links and references
- [ ] implement a transient solver
