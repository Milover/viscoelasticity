Note classification:

- notes named as existing directories should be in their respective directories

notes.description:
	- should contain input data for the case
	- notes related to boundary conditions and input data

notes.general
	- should contain general notes related to case setup/simulation
	- unspecified notes, eg. related to other software

notes.info
	- contains instructions on how to build/document/archive the simulation

notes.test
	- should contain test data
	- only notes related to performed tests

notes.geometry
	- should contain notes on geometry used for case setup if geometries differ
	  between cases

notes.mesh
	- should contain a listing of meshes and cases in which they were used

1 - non-active cases should be ready-to-run and contain only files pertinent to
	running them, all logs, results etc. should be removed once they are no
	longer active, the 0.orig directory contains ASCII backups of all the
	fields prior to running the case and the Allrun file contains all the
	necessary steps to build and run the case from scratch

2 - should contain all of the geometry (.step, .iges...) used in building the
	cases, if the geometry differs between the cases it should be named the
	same as the mesh it was used for, subdirectories are allowed and should be
	used as necessary

3 - meshes should be named according to the following template:
		
	<geometry_name>_<mesh_type>_<cell_count>.<mesh_format>

	subdirectories are allowed and should be used as necessary

4 - should contain files, scripts, code etc. used for postprocessing,
	subdirectories are allowed and should be named as the cases from which
	the data originates

5 - should contain all files required to generate the report sorted in their
	respective directories

6 - should contain case data, in directories named after the cases, that should
	be stored after the case is no longer active ie. selected results, logs...

7 - should contain only system directories used for performing optimization
	tests, if case setup data is changed other than what is contained in the
	system directory (eg. boundary conditions) then a new case should be made
	instead
